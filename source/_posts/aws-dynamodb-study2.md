### Query and Scan the Table

**Step 5.1: Run a Query**

This section provides examples of Query operations. The queries are specified against the Music table. Remember, the table primary key is made of Artist (partition key) and SongTitle (sort key).

Query using only the partition key. For example, find songs by an artist.
Query using both the partition key and the sort key. For example, find songs by an artist and song title starting with a specific string.
Filter query results. Find songs by an artist and then return only those songs that have more than three radio stations playing them.
